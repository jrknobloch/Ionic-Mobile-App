# Ionic-Mobile-App
Website for Ionic Mobile App

Ionic generates code that you can use as is to put the application on the web.All you have to do is upload the www folder with FTP to your favorite server. 
And it can be used as a web application on any mobile device. You can view the current branch of the project on my website at

The other option is to have Ionic generate native code for different devices so that you can place those in the respective app stores.

For instructions just go to the Ionic Web site at http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/ and look for the guides for each one of 
the platforms i.e.  Android or iOS.

If you take a look at those, you'll notice that deploying for those platforms requires a lot of installations. 
To deploy apps on an Android device, you'll need to install Java, the Android SDK, and Android Studio with specific platforms 
you want to deploy to.

For iOS you have to have a Mac and be registered as a developer, plus install the developer tools.
